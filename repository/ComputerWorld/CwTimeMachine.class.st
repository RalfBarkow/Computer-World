Commands adapted from http://www.macworld.com/article/2033804/control-time-machine-from-the-command-line.html

# Target

## Other files
You can have other files in the destination. TM will not disturb them, but will happily create a sparsebundle alongside them.

## IP Address changes
Time Machine stores metainfo about the backup on the target, not the source, so you can just remove the target with the old IP and add a new one with the new IP. TM will recognize the backup and keep adding to it, preserving the history.
