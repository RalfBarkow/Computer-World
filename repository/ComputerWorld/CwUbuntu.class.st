	self notify: '- Hard Drive: Desktop says it needs 8GB space, but would not install in a VB so-equipped. In very light use for about a year, useage was about 12GB, so 16GB is doable but 32GB might be safer (although apparently you can always increase the size via VB command line
- RAM: 4GB seems to be working okay (IIRC that was the Ubuntu min req.)
- Processor: 1 core working okay, in process of comparing to 2 cores; there were forums about problems with CPU settings (e.g. nested paging, paravirtualization), but haven''t noticed anything.
- Graphics: ***The VB-recommended 1MB led to serious hanging when e.g. DNDing windows. 32MB eliminated that problem.
